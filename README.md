# HCI Lab Components

A consolidated overview of topics covered across the HCI lab activity documents in this repository. This helps you (and reviewers) quickly see what each lab includes and jump to the right file.

## At a glance

- Lab 1: device evaluation, console comparison, and GenAI pros/cons
- Lab 3: user interview for a design tool (Lovable), task breakdowns, and RCA
- Lab 4: cognitive tests (Active Memory), scoring, and HCI heuristics (attention/memory)
- Lab 5: mental and conceptual models, interface metaphors, and classification exercise

## Lab 1 Activities (`Lab 1 Activities.docx`)

Focus
- Personal device evaluation (external monitor) for productivity and ergonomics
- Console ecosystem comparison (Xbox vs competitors)
- Generative AI advantages and disadvantages

---

## Lab 3 Activities (`Akshit Lab 3 Activities.docx`)

Focus
- User interview for the “Lovable” UI/UX & AI design/coding tool
- Usage frequency and recent interactions
- Top tasks and sub‑tasks (time, importance, experience, challenges, improvements)

## Lab 4 Activities (`HCI - Lab 4 Activities.docx`)

Focus
- Active Memory cognitive test (link provided) and scoring summary
- HCI considerations: attention (context, visual clutter) and memory (overload, complexity)

---

## Lab 5 Activities (`Akshit Lab -5 activity.docx`)

Focus
- Mental and conceptual models in interaction design
- Common interface metaphors and interaction patterns
- Classification exercise (domain objects, tasks/operations, interface metaphors)
